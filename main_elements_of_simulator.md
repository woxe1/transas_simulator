1.  Describe and demonstrate main simulator components and their designation. Models: A, B or C.
-------------------------

**Tanker is a special type of vessel for carrying liquids, especially mineral oils in bulk.**

Model A consists of a bottom tabs where we can navigate through different places onboard the tanker:
- For example we can go to the bridge and look at the bridge control console (**BCC**). Where the deck department can control the vessel by different control elements like steering wheel.
- Then we can see Engiene Control Room (**ECR**) where we can monitor and control the most of ER mechanisms like main engine.
- **MSB** - Main electrical Switchboard. By this tab we can switch for example on the Main Circuit Diagram(MCD) and get detailed information about the current state of the electrical station. Also we can find local group starter panels with according Circuit Breakers this may be helpful for example when we are looking for insulation breakdown.
- **CMS** - Control and Monitoring System - This tab allows us to check current alarms, e.g. insulation resistance condition of Marine Growth Protection System alarms. It's very important system which allow monitoring of overall vessel condition
- **BMCS** - Boiler Monitoring & Control system. It's integrated Personal Computer based system for remote supervision of the ship's aux boiler and related systems. We can control motors of boiler's system, such as feed water pump, circulation pump from that tab if these motors are in remote control mode.
- **Diag** - This tab modeling Cylinder Indicator Diagrams of the main propulsion and Diesel engines of the generators and combustion process. Indicator Diagram looks like:

it describes relationship

$$
\frac{Angle \quad of \quad rotation \quad of \quad the \quad crankshaft}
{Pressure \quad in \quad cylinder}
$$
</div>

- **SYS** - Describes the main systems of tankers like fresh water system, sea water system, fuel oil, air compressed systems and so on. From that tab we can control different valves.
- **SG** - Steering Gear room page. We can check our motors, in that model RAM-type steering gear used with axial-reciprocating pumps where we can change the pressure of oil by incline built-in pump plate. So we can change the position of piston and incline of rudder blade.
- **ER1...ER4** This is decks of engine room, where ER1 is the bottom deck where we can find our oil water separator control panel for turning gear and another machines, it's very convinient
- **FFR** - Fire Fighting Room - it's a room where we can different shut-off valves control panels and foam system
- **EmG** - Emergency Generator Room. In that room we can find our Emergency switchboard (MSBD) and our emergency diesel-generator control panel and shore connection panel.
- **CCR** - Cargo control room for control cargo equipment
