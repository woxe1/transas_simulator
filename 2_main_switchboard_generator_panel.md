### Default
For starting the engine we need to provide in enough pressure of fuel. Enough pressure is created by the diesel oil generator engine pumps (DO GE pumps). This model of tanker has two such pumps.  One is electrical the second is pneumatic. We can see that on the tab Fuel Oil Service Main Engine and Generator Engine system:

 - SYS → FO ME GE Service System

We need to open the pneumatic valve 3.

Then we need make some settings on Synchro panel:

We need to choose standby generator with help of selector switch "STANDBY SELECTION", let it be the first generator. Also with the help of selector switch number two we choose OPTIONAL load-sharing mode.
